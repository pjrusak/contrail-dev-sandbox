If you want to use Vagrant:
* run "vagrant up" followed by "vagrant ssh"
* run "sudo -i", then "cd /home/vagrant/contrail-dev-sandbox"

run "make presetup" once to prepare the environment for further tasks

If you want to checkout the contrail code:
* run "make checkout_vnc"

run "make all" to start the full pipeline
